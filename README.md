wk4: Tweaked print stack and print queue to be able to print none similar to print deque. is empty if no nodes prints true or false if a node, and size reports number of nodes, if zero 0, and if nodes exist their count. This change is only to make all the print stack/queue print none if no nodes vice error, or empty or raise.

First and Final submission in git Hub. This is an update to canvas and these updates will be posted as fnal in canvas with updated videos. This updates the .size method for stack and queue. Not that my program uses them as methods, but I wanted the size function of all three to work the same. Most updates are grammar beyond that in comments. Size will report if 0, return 0, vice none or raising an error or Empty. This is greatly explained in the Deque video. is_empty will report True if empty, size will report size if 0 or 1 or 10 etc; print_queue will print none if there is none in the stack, queue or deque. This is my preference for sort of minimizing unnecessary errors and providing more useful feedback to the user.

Professor Tim Kyle: Initial submission to walk thru the git hub upload. This file should be ready for you to review. It is likely final, 
but I still need to do the second file punishment and the two videos and then will declare final. If you can take a
quick glance as the file and confirm I have moved this to where you can see it, it will let me know I made it thru 
initial submission for this file. v/rMike Craft

PS. Added the file puhishment.py. Will work on the videos and submit finals in the next day or two. I wanted to 1: give you a look at the code, and 2: make sure I am using git to get the files to you. thanks v/r Mike

Fri 3/13 am uploaded an update to is_multiple.py that added pre-emptive error control for divide by zero for the second number m.

Fri 3/13 uploaded admin cleanup and a minor update to string formatting for punishment.py.

Sat 3/14 uploaded final is_multiple.py and punishment.py that includes minor comment addition for the else break for is.multiple.py.

Sun 3/15 last update are th files in branch final-submission-update-with-files. I commented out 2 uses of continue (on the excepts) that were not needed. I retained use of a continue statement on the zero division handling and updated the print statement on the zero division handling. Although the previous version ran correct, this is a cleaner and more accurate use of when and where to use continue.

Sun 3/15 eliminated use of break by initialized a while loop variable running and looping set to True. Avoids lazy coding and what is essentially an infinite loop that I was breaking out of. Includes some admin cleanup.
