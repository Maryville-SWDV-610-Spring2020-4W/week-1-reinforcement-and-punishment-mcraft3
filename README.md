Professor Tim Kyle: Initial submission to walk thru the git hub upload. This file should be ready for you to review. It is likely final, 
but I still need to do the second file punishment and the two videos and then will declare final. If you can take a
quick glance as the file and confirm I have moved this to where you can see it, it will let me know I made it thru 
initial submission for this file. v/rMike Craft

PS. Added the file puhishment.py. Will work on the videos and submit finals in the next day or two. I wanted to 1: give you a look at the code, and 2: make sure I am using git to get the files to you. thanks v/r Mike

Fri 3/13 am uploaded an update to is_multiple.py that added pre-emptive error control for divide by zero for the second number m.

Fri 3/13 uploaded admin cleanup and a minor update to string formatting for punishment.py.

Sat 3/14 uploaded final is_multiple.py and punishment.py that includes minor comment addition for the else break for is.multiple.py.

Sun 3/15 last update are th files in branch final-submission-update-with-files. I commented out 2 uses of continue (on the excepts) that were not needed. I retained use of a continue statement on the zero division handling and updated the print statement on the zero division handling. Although the previous version ran correct, this is a cleaner and more accurate use of when and where to use continue.

Sun 3/15 eliminated use of break by initialized a while loop variable running and looping set to True. Avoids lazy coding and what is essentially an infinite loop that I was breaking out of. Includes some admin cleanup.
